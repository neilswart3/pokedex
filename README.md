## Basic Pokedex

A little fun project to play around a bit with the pokemon api and the following technologies:

- React
- Typescript
- NextJs app router
- TailwindsCSS
- React context and useReducer. (Where I would normally go for redux, I decided to make my own state management)
- Framer Motion (animation library)
- Storybook for documenting my atomic components
